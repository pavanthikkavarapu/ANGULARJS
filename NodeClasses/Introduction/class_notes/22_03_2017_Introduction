What is NodeJS ?

    - NodeJS is the Server Side Scripting Language.

    - NodeJS Implemented By using Google Chrome v8 Engine.

    - Node Applications Acting as a Business Components as well as Servers.

    - By using NodeJS we can create the Both http & tcp servers.

    - As a Node Developer we Can Assign the Port Numbers to the Servers.

    - Node Applications won't Buffer the Data because of CallBacks in NodeJS.

        [Note.
                Node will collect the Data 'packets by packets' and stores into a Node Engine ,

                will flush the Data at a Time With the Help of Callbacks. ]

    - Node Internally will manage the Requests Pool Mechanism (Object Name . Requests Queue).

    - Node Will Identifies the Blocked & Non Blocked Requests

    - Node Engine Will Assign the Threads to the Blocked Requests from the Thread Pool Mechanism.

    Ex.

        Blocked Request  -   Reading the Data From the DataBase.

        Non Blocked Request - Evaluation Of Expression , Returning the Static Data.

    - Node Engine Internally have a so many predefined Modules , As a Node Developer we can use the Predefined Modules.


    1.http

        used to develop the Http Servers with our own port numbers.

    Ex.

        server.js
        -
        var http = require("http");  // Importing the http module
        http.createServer(my_fun);   // Creating the http server , "my_fun" is the "callback/Handler"
        function my_fun(req,res){   // Implementing the Call Back
            //Code
        }.listen(8080);             //Assigning the Port Number.
        console.log("My Http Server Ready with the Port No . 8080");

    2.fs

        - "fs" stands for file system.
        - "fs" module is the Predefined Module.
        - This Module used to read the Data from the Static Data Files.

            Ex.

                    Static Text files
                    Static XML Files
                    Static JSON Files

                    --
                    --

            var fs = require("fs");
            var http = require("http");
            http.createServer(function(req,res){
                fs.readFileSync("https://www.w3schools.com/angular/customers.php",my_fun);
                function my_fun(err,data){
                        res.send(data);
                }
            }).listen(8080);
            console.log("Server Listening the Port No.8080");
