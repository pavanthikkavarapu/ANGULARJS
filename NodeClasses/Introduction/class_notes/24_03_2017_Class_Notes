Architecture Of NodeJS.

    Internal Components Of Node Engine Called as Architecture


Components Are.

1.Thread Pool Mechanism

    - Thread Pool Mechanism Maintains the Number Of Threads.

    - Thread Pool Mechanism will have the Threads Based on

      the System Architecture.

    - One Sys Architecture to Another Sys Architecture ,

      thread count may change.

2. Requests Queue Mechanism.

    Node Engine Will Maintain Internally Requests Queue Mechanism.

    All the Client Requests will Store into Requests Queue Mechanism.

3. Event Driven Mechanism.

    - It's a Special Mechanism in Node Engine.

    - Event Driven Mechanism will Access all the Requests

      from Requests Queue Mechanism.

    - Event Driven Mechanism will identifies the type of request from client.

    - Event Driven Mechanism have the capability to process the Non Blocking Requests.

    - All the Blocked Requests Are Deligates to Helper Object.

    - Helper Object will Assign the Threads from the

      Thread Pool Mechanism to Blocked Request Based on the Availability.

    - Helper Object will deligates the Response to the Event Driven Mechanism.

    - Finally Event Driven Mechanism Responisible to

      Dispatch the Response to the Client.


Environmental Setup.

    - The Softwares Required to Run the Node Application

      called as Environmental Setup.

1.Download and Install the NodeJS.

Website :https://node.org/downloads

file name : node-v6.10.1-64-bit.msi


2. IDE'S  -- WebStrom, Sublime Text Editor, Brackets, Ecilipse,VS


Steps to Create the First Node Application.

Step 1.

    



    - The Name of the Node Configuration file is package.json.

we can run the Node Configuration File By using following command

1.npm install

    npm stands for Node Packaging Manager.
